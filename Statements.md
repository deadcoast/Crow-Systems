- **Day (RGB):** “Open-water human detection has an **established benchmark (SeaDronesSee)** with tens of thousands of annotated frames from **UAV altitudes 5–260 m**; baseline models and leaderboards provide **auditable precision/recall** under glare and sea-state variability.” ([CVF Open Access](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Varga_SeaDronesSee_A_Maritime_Benchmark_for_Detecting_Humans_in_Open_Water_WACV_2022_paper.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "SeaDronesSee - WACV 2022 Open Access Repository"))

[[6 - Probability over Uniform Patterns]]

* “Search theory (Koopman; USCG) shows that distributing effort in proportion to **probability density** yields higher **POS** than uniform coverage.”
* “USCG’s **SAROPS** and **IAMSAR** doctrine formalize probability-weighted search; the approach is operationally recognized and embedded in national SAR planning.”
* “Simulation studies demonstrate **10–30% improvement in expected detection rates** with probability-weighted grids compared to expanding square or uniform track spacing.”
* “`CROW` UAV sorties can apply the same principle at micro-scale, focusing endurance on the **near-datum high-probability plume** to cut time-to-first-visual.”

[[7 - A) Data Capturing & Audit]]

* “VDR carriage and performance standards (SOLAS V/20; **MSC.333(90)**) exist explicitly to preserve incident data for **investigation and cause identification**; aligning UAV evidence capture and retention with VDR practice strengthens accountability and compliance.” ([IMO][1])
* “An **ISM-compliant SMS** requires formal **reporting and analysis** of incidents and non-conformities; structured digital records (video/telemetry/logs) directly support that mandate.” ([Maritime Safety Innovation Lab LLC][3])
* “Applying **ACPO/ISO 27037** evidence-handling principles (immutability, audit trails, competent access) and **NIST SHA-256** hashing produces **tamper-evident** records suitable for internal review or external scrutiny.” ([NPCC][6])
* “**UTC-synchronized** records via **NTP/PTP** ensure that VDR, bridge logs, UAV video, and telemetry are **co-related** within milliseconds or better, as required for reliable reconstruction.” ([RFC Editor][8])
