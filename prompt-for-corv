thats much better. I need to solidify this format in my documents so they are properly linked in a professional, organized format. PLEASE DESIGN A `.markdownlint.jsonc` to enforce a professional styling for my document suite. This document suite is a mixture of:

document_suite =(
    `Proof of Concept`,
    `Technical Documentation`,
    `Research`,
    `Mathematical Formulas in Mathjax`,
    `Equations in Mathjax`,
    `Code Blocks in Python, JavaScript, etc.`,
)

**PLEASE NOTE** this is a GITHUB REPOSITORY. IT HOUSES TWO VERSIONS. ONE FOR OBSIDIAN, AND ONE FOR GITHUB.`THE GITHUB REPOSTIROY CAN CHANGE THE OBSIDIAN VERSION`, BUT THE OBSIDIAN VERSION CANNOT CHANGE THE GITHUB VERSION. IGNORE THE OBSIDIAN VERSION. WE ARE ONLY DESIGNING THE DOCUMENTS TO BE A PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENT SUITE ON GITHUB. `THE OBSIDIAN VERSION IS TO STAY AS IS, AND IS THE OBSIDIAN FRIENDLY FORMAT HOSTED ON THE REPO.`
