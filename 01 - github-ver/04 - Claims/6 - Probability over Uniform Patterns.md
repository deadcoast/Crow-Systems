# CLAIM ‚Äî ‚ÄúProbability-weighted search beats uniform patterns.‚Äù

Probability-weighted search is not experimental: it is codified in **IAMSAR**, operationalized in **USCG SAROPS**, and mathematically proven since Koopman. Applying this doctrine at UAV scale means `CROW` sorties concentrate endurance where it matters, yielding **faster detection and higher overall POS** than uniform grid searches.

## A) Independent Evidence

1. **Search theory foundations**

   - U.S. Coast Guard ‚Äú*Theory of Search*‚Äù explains that **Probability of Success (POS) = Probability of Containment (POC) √ó Probability of Detection (POD)**. Optimal search maximizes **POS** by distributing effort proportionally to where the target is most likely located, rather than uniformly.
   - Koopman (1946) pioneered mathematical search theory, still the basis of **SAROPS** (Search And Rescue Optimal Planning System) used by USCG. His equations show that effort allocation weighted by probability densities yields a higher expected detection rate than uniform coverage.

2. **Operational precedent: SAROPS & IAMSAR**

   - **SAROPS** (USCG operational system) generates **probability density surfaces** from leeway, drift, and environment data, then prescribes search patterns weighted to those densities.
   - **IAMSAR Manual Vol. II** incorporates probability distribution grids and directs that **search patterns be adapted to the highest-probability areas first**, confirming this is recognized doctrine.

3. **Empirical benefit**

   - Studies of simulated SAR operations demonstrate that allocating effort proportionally to Bayesian probability grids improves **time-to-detection and overall POD** compared with expanding square or sector patterns flown uniformly.
   - Royal Navy drone trials noted earlier also imply UAVs can act as **rapid probability probes** over high-likelihood sectors, which aligns with weighted search logic.

### Additional Areas for Research

- **Bayesian drift modeling**: Incorporate **NOAA‚Äôs SAROPS drift modules** (stochastic particle models) as inputs to UAV grid planning.
- **Monte Carlo validation**: Run retrospective analyses on historic MOB drift cases to quantify how fast the target leaves uniform search cells vs. how weighted search captures them.
- **Dynamic reprioritization**: Leverage UAV onboard compute to recompute **probability maps every 30‚Äì60 s** as wind/current data update.
- **Sensor sweep width factors**: Literature defines sweep width as a function of **sensor altitude, FOV, and sea state**; weighting can incorporate changing POD per sweep band.

## B) Quantitative thresholds

- **Coverage factor (C):** defined as W/S, where W = sweep width, S = track spacing. Weighted search aims for **C ‚âà 1 in high-prob zones** and **C < 1 in low-prob zones**, raising overall POS.
- **POS uplift:** SAROPS evaluations report **10‚Äì30% higher expected success** vs uniform patterns under realistic wind/current.
- **UAV sortie model:** UAV with 30 min endurance can cover **~3‚Äì5 km¬≤ at C ‚âà 1**; weighted search directs that endurance into high-probability quadrants, effectively increasing Pdet within endurance limits.

## C) Binder-ready statements

- ‚ÄúSearch theory shows distributing effort in proportion to **probability density** yields higher POS than uniform coverage.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúUSCG SAROPS and IAMSAR doctrine formalize probability-weighted search; the approach is operational, not experimental.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSimulation studies demonstrate **10‚Äì30% improvement in detection** with probability-weighted grids vs. expanding square or uniform spacing.‚Äù
