# CROW: First-Response Drone System for Cruise Ships

## The Problem

- Every man-overboard (MOB) is a crisis. From a 20–50 story drop, survival depends on seconds.
- Cold shock, unconscious impact injuries, and night conditions mean that unless a victim is located immediately, they are quickly lost in wake and drift.
- Current response: MOB alarm → bridge turn → rescue boat prep → wide search. This process routinely takes tens of minutes to hours before re-acquisition — long past the golden survival window.

### Key Factors

- **Drop height = near fatal**: From 10–50 meters, survivability is already compromised (impact injuries, unconsciousness, internal trauma).
- **Cold shock**: Even in temperate water, survival time can be measured in minutes without flotation.
- **Visibility loss**: Within seconds, the person disappears from the bridge's line of sight; currents and ship wake scatter them fast.
- **Response lag**: Ship maneuvers + boat prep + search patterns = hours before recovery. Survival window = minutes.

**Why This Matters:**

*Seconds Save Lives*, the sudden immersion in cold water triggers the cold-shock response: rapid hyperventilation, arrhythmias, and loss of breathing control in the first minute; survivability drops fast without immediate aid. Recent peer-review and overview texts document these acute, early-minute risks and their direct link to mortality in open water. ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306456523003169?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Habituation of the cold shock response: A systematic ..."))

- **Life-saving speed:** `CROW` closes the critical gap between the alarm and the moment a victim is lost from view.
- **Regulatory alignment:** SOLAS already mandates rapid MOB response. `CROW` positions operators ahead of future IMO/USCG expectations for drones as “auxiliary lifesaving equipment.”
- **Insurer reassurance:** Documented early-response capability reduces liability, payout exposure, and strengthens compliance audits.
- **Public relations:** In the aftermath of an MOB, operators can demonstrate immediate, visible action — protecting reputation and passenger trust.
- **Low cost, high impact:** At ~$25–40k per ship, the cost is negligible compared to ship budgets, but the value in lives saved and crises prevented is immeasurable.

**Key Advantages Over Current Practice:**

- **Seconds, not minutes:** Airborne in under 20 seconds after MOB alarm.
- **Search, don’t guess:** Probability-weighted search patterns using wind/current drift models.
- **Human control:** Drone pilot in command after auto-launch; no autonomy beyond IRD.
- **Scalable:** Dock + drone set can be deployed fleetwide with minimal crew training.

## `CROW` Systems Solution

**System Ideology:**

- Medical urgency is front-loaded into the first minutes after splash — locating fast is the lever that matters (cold-shock literature). ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306456523003169?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Habituation of the cold shock response: A systematic ..."))
- Cruise overboards are not one-offs; the rescue rate is poor, so a technology that shrinks time-to-first-visual is materially useful (CLIA report). ([Cruise Lines International Association](https://cruising.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/report_operational_incidents_2019-v-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Report on Operational Incidents 2009 to 2019 For CLIA ..."))  
- Your product does not fight the standard; it complements **ISO 21195** detection by acting immediately on its alarm to search the drift envelope from above. ([Iteh](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/76051/c3ad63c1e50e4901911cca54874631d9/ISO-21195-2020.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO 21195"))  
- Your search method can be defended using **SAROPS** doctrine, which stakeholders already respect. ([USCG Mission Support](https://www.dcms.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Acquisitions-CG-9/International-Acquisition/SAROPS/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System"))  
- Aerial “find/mark” with pilot control is not speculative; the **Royal Navy** has demonstrated the workflow, including **buoy drop and beacon hover**. ([Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news/2021/july/02/210702-drone-trials-mob?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Navy tests drones in man overboard trials"))

**System Design:**

- **Automatic Launch:** On MOB alarm, `CROW` undocks instantly and executes a short, bounded **Initial Rescue Diagnostic (IRD)** grid around the Last Known Position (LKP). Within 60–120 seconds, the drone is airborne, scanning with infrared and visible cameras.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** After the IRD, the trained onboard drone pilot takes over with handheld controls and video goggles. This guarantees **human judgment** in all rescue actions while the system buys precious early seconds.
- **Locate & Mark:** `CROW` provides a bird’s-eye view no human lookout can match, detecting thermal signatures against waves, marking exact GPS coordinates, and hovering as a visual/IR beacon.
- **Immediate Aid:** At pilot command, `CROW` can drop a lightweight, auto-inflating flotation device, dye marker, or strobe beacon, keeping the casualty afloat and visible until rescue craft arrive.
- **Bridge Integration:** Live video, GPS, and probability-based drift maps are fed into the ship’s bridge displays, guiding both the drone pilot and the rescue boat crew.

## Drone Design

Immediate response, Spot, Drop Buoyency, Monitor.

- **Rapid deployment:** 5x5 foot quadcopter stored in a weatherproof cradle near deck rails; auto-launch when MOB alarm triggers.
- **Autonomous tracking:** IR + optical camera + GPS tie-in to the MOB detection alarm (last-known position). Drone executes a pre-set grid around the datum.
- **Mark & monitor:** once located, drone hovers as a visual beacon (light + strobe + GPS feed).
- **Buoyancy drop:** deploys a lightweight auto-inflating life ring or dye-marker. Doesn’t need payload beyond 2–3 kg.
- **Live feed:** bridge and rescue crew get thermal/visual confirmation, eliminating false alarms.

**probability-guided search is the accepted method.** The U.S. Coast Guard’s **SAROPS** is Monte-Carlo based: it propagates thousands of particles under wind/current and produces a probability map that planners search first. That is the orthodox approach you can mirror near-ship to decide where your pilot flies next after the initial datum. Citing SAROPS grounds your search math in what maritime authorities already use. ([U.S. Coast Guard](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-5R/SARfactsInfo/SAROPSInforSheet.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS)"))

**drones as find/mark tools are already field-tested.** The Royal Navy publicly reports trials where **remotely-piloted systems located personnel in the water, dropped life-saving equipment, and hovered as a beacon until rescuers arrived** — exactly the role you’re proposing, with human pilots in the loop. Multiple independent outlets and the Navy’s own release describe the drills at Horsea Island and at sea. Use the Navy page as your primary; keep one trade source as corroboration.

## Cruise Line incentive

**How often this happens on cruises:** An industry-commissioned analysis of cruise overboards (2009–2019) tallied 212 incidents with 48 rescues — about **28%** rescued alive; the rest were not recovered alive. That’s your baseline to beat, and it is the number safety officers know. ([Cruise Lines International Association](https://cruising.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/report_operational_incidents_2019-v-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Report on Operational Incidents 2009 to 2019 For CLIA ...")) (You’ll see the same 212/28% figure echoed in secondary summaries aimed at the public; use the CLIA/G.P. Wild PDF as your primary citation in decks.) ([Kherkher Garcia](https://www.kherkhergarcia.com/how-common-cruise-guest-overboard-incidents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How Common are Cruise Guest Overboard Incidents?"))

- **PR disaster avoidance.** Every MOB incident is global news; drones give a line something concrete to show regulators, insurers, and media.
- **Compliance pressure.** IMO/USCG are leaning on operators to adopt “reasonable available technology” for MOB. Drones can become the obvious next standard.
- **Low cost, high ROI.** A rugged IR-equipped drone package with weatherproof docking stations might be **$25k–50k per ship**. For a billion-dollar vessel, it’s negligible.
- **Brand differentiator.** Lines like Royal Caribbean, MSC, and Carnival compete on safety PR as much as luxury. A “next-gen MOB rescue drone system” is a selling point.

**What Cruise Liners buy today (and what they don’t).** The international standard **ISO 21195:2020** specifies the technical requirements for **non-wearable man-overboard detection systems** — the camera/IR/microwave pods that alarm the bridge when someone goes over the side. It explicitly scopes detection of a person going overboard and, by design, excludes wearable tags; it does not address aerial localization or marking. The `CROW` system sits immediately downstream of this standard: act on the alarm to **find and mark** at sea. ([Iteh](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/76051/c3ad63c1e50e4901911cca54874631d9/ISO-21195-2020.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ISO 21195"))

## Challenges to Solve

- **Ruggedization:** salt spray, high winds, 24/7 standby. Needs marine-grade enclosure and rapid auto-check charging station.
- **Automation:** crew can’t fiddle with joysticks; must be one-button (or alarm-triggered) deployment.
- **Regulatory approval:** coordinate with classification societies (Lloyd’s Register, DNV, ABS) so drones are certified as auxiliary MOB equipment.
- **Fleet integration:** tie into existing MOB alarms and bridge systems seamlessly.

---

**Conclusive Goal:**

- Partner with `CROW` to run **sea trials on your vessels**.
- Validate time-to-detection improvements in real MOB drills.
- Move toward fleetwide adoption as the industry’s first certified **Maritime MOB Drone Response System**.

`CROW` Drone Systems are designed to be **“The world’s first certified maritime MOB drone system, setting the standards.”**

MOB Drones are an unfilled niche right now, a category ready for standards to be set. Cruise lines want turnkey, class-approved product they can bolt onto every ship. A structured and Professional platform that requires them to do minimal work on their already large ecosystem.
