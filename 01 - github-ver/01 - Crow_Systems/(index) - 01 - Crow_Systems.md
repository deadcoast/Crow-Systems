## System Architecture

The CROW system consists of several integrated components:

1. **Drone Platform**: Marine-ruggedized quadcopter with thermal and RGB sensors
2. **Dock System**: Automated launch and recovery station with environmental protection
3. **Bridge Interface**: Control and monitoring system for ship integration
4. **Payload System**: Rescue equipment deployment and marking capabilities
5. **Evidence System**: Data capture and audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Key Performance Targets

- **Auto-launch latency**: ≤ 20 seconds from MOB alarm
- **Time-to-first-visual**: ≤ 90 seconds in benign conditions
- **Detection probability**: ≥ 0.8 within first sortie envelope
- **False positive rate**: ≤ 0.2/min with human verification
- **Drop accuracy**: ≤ 10m CEP (95%) for rescue equipment deployment
