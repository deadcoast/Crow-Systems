# CRUISE OVERBOARD AND WATCH DRONE (CROW DRONE)

If you want, I can turn this into:

- a **Gantt-style timeline** with dependencies,
- a **requirements checklist** for a partner cruise line,
- and a **pre-registration protocol template** (objectives, endpoints, stats plan) you can drop into your trials binder.

- extract numerical precision/recall and latency figures from the 2024 IR detection paper;
- tabulate pixel-footprint vs altitude thresholds from that and related studies;
- compile sea-state-indexed false-positive modes (whitecaps, glare) and mitigation evidence, each with citations.
