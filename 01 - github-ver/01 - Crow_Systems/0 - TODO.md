# CROW Systems Development Tasks #

## Project Overview ##

This document outlines the development tasks and milestones for the CROW (Coastal Rescue Operations with Wings) Drone Systems project.

## Development Options ##

The following development approaches are available:

- **Gantt-style timeline** with dependencies and critical path analysis
- **Requirements checklist** for partner cruise line integration
- **Pre-registration protocol template** with objectives, endpoints, and statistical analysis plan for trials

## Research Tasks ##

### Technical Analysis ###

- Extract numerical precision/recall and latency figures from the 2024 IR detection paper
- Tabulate pixel-footprint vs altitude thresholds from relevant studies
- Compile sea-state-indexed false-positive modes (whitecaps, glare) and mitigation evidence with citations

### Performance Validation ###

- Establish baseline detection performance metrics
- Develop altitude optimization algorithms
- Create false-positive mitigation strategies

### Documentation Requirements ###

- Technical specification updates
- Performance validation reports
- Integration protocol documentation

## Project Milestones ##

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis ###

- Literature review completion
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Performance baseline establishment

### Phase 2: Prototype Development ###

- System architecture design
- Component specification
- Integration planning

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation ###

- Harbor trials
- Open-sea trials
- Performance validation

### Phase 4: Deployment Preparation ###

- Partner integration
- Regulatory compliance
- Fleet deployment planning
