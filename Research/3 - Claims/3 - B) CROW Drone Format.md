# ANNEX — Latency Budget (Encode → Transport → Decode) & HUD/Goggles Symbology

## 1) Definitions & targets (reviewer-facing)

* **Glass-to-glass latency** = time from photons at the camera lens to photons on the pilot display. Industry defines and measures this end-to-end interval explicitly; sub-second is considered low-latency for streaming in general, but **teleoperation** requires **$≲150–200 ms$** to preserve control quality. ([Mux][1])
* **Dock/enterprise links today:** DJI Dock 2 specifies **$≈110–150 ms$** aircraft→dock video latency (environment-dependent). DJI O3/O3 Pro point-to-point video subsystems publish **$≈70 ms$** at 1080p/60. Mavic 3 Enterprise lists **$~200 ms$** typical live-view latency. These values bound realistic budgets. ([DJI][2])
* **Human performance anchor:** Teleoperation/telesurgery studies show mild impact at **$0–200 ms$**, noticeable degradation **$~300–700 ms$**, and severe effects $≥800–1000 ms$. Reaction-time literature places **visual SRT $≈200–250 ms$**, choice RT $≈300–400 ms$. These anchors justify an **operational ceiling $≤200$ ms** for pilot-in-command (PIC). ([PubMed][3])

## 2) End-to-end latency budget (componentized)

### 2.1 Budget table (1080p/60 input; hardware encoder/decoder; LAN/shipboard backhaul)

| Stage        | Sub-component (example)                 | Best-case (ms) | Typical (ms) | Upper bound (ms) | Notes / sources                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------: | -----------: | ---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensor/ISP   | Exposure + readout + ISP                |           5–12 |         8–16 |               20 | Short rolling-shutter + ISP pipelines                                                  |
| Encode       | H.264/H.265 HW, low-latency mode        |           5–15 |        10–25 |               40 | HW encoders publish low-latency modes (AMD/Xilinx VCU). ([AMD Documentation][4])       |
| Packetize    | RTP/RTSP/SRT sender                     |            1–5 |          3–8 |               15 | Queueing dominates; protocol adds few ms. ([Mux][1])                                   |
| **Air link** | UAV → Dock/RC (O3/O3 Pro / Dock 2)      |         **70** |  **110–150** |              180 | Published latencies; environment-dependent. ([DJI Official][5])                        |
| Backhaul     | Dock → pilot console (LAN/ship)         |           2–10 |        10–30 |               60 | Wired/Wi-Fi/5G variability; adds headroom. ([Streaming Media][6])                      |
| Decode       | HW decode (pilot device)                |           5–12 |        10–20 |               35 | Paired with low-latency encode; see VCU notes. ([AMD Documentation][4])                |
| Render       | Compositor + display scanout (60–90 Hz) |           8–16 |        12–20 |               33 | One frame at 60–90 Hz + HUD overlay cost                                               |
| **Total**    | **Glass-to-glass**                      |     **96–135** |  **153–289** |     **383–383+** | Meets ≤200 ms in best/typical dock scenarios; ensure headroom via settings. ([DJI][2]) |

**Interpretation:** With a dock-class link (≈110–150 ms aircraft→dock) and low-latency encode/decode, **≤200 ms** glass-to-glass is achievable in controlled RF conditions; budgets drift toward **~250 ms** as backhaul/decoding overheads grow. Keep PIC operations within the **≤200 ms** envelope whenever possible to remain in the “mild impact” regime from teleoperation literature. ([PubMed][3])

### 2.2 Control-loop (command) latency

* **Uplink command path** (stick→console→dock→UAV) typically runs parallel to video with smaller payloads and comparable or lower latency; human-factors studies emphasize **end-to-end perceptual delay** (video) as the dominant limiter of performance, with **~150–200 ms** as the practical ceiling for precise manual control. ([PubMed][3])

### 2.3 Measurement & acceptance

* **Measurement method:** industry-standard “stopwatch in frame” glass-to-glass test (camera films a digital timer, pilot display is re-filmed; difference is latency). Use this for acceptance and periodic checks. ([Wowza][7])
* **Acceptance thresholds (business-plan ready):**

  * **PIC mode:** ≤**200 ms** required, ≤**150 ms** preferred (document measured median and 95th percentile). ([PubMed][3])
  * **Auto-launch IRD only:** may tolerate up to **250–300 ms** because no precision piloting occurs pre-takeover; still record and report.

## 3) Takeover timeline (bounded by human+link)

* **Alarm → auto-launch (dock) → climb/clear ship → PIC live feed → PIC control affirmed**

| Element                  |               Target | Justification                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dock auto-launch start   |               ≤ 15 s | Automated sequence initiation                                                |
| Wheels-up to 10–20 m AGL |               ≤ 20 s | Conservative climb/clear-ship profile                                        |
| Live feed stable at PIC  | ≤ 2 s post-wheels-up | Link locks immediately; **110–150 ms** video latency supports SA. ([DJI][2]) |
| Pilot takeover window    |   ≥ 0.3–0.5 s prompt | Choice RT **~300–400 ms**; affords confirm-click margin. ([Cognaction][8])   |
| **Glass-to-glass (PIC)** |     **≤ 150–200 ms** | Preserves teleop performance headroom. ([PubMed][3])                         |

## 4) HUD / Goggles symbology (pilot SA & workload)

### 4.1 Symbology set (with rationale)

* **Horizon line + pitch ladder** — stabilizes attitude perception during ship-induced wind shear and yaw transients; reduces vestibular/visual conflict. HUD studies link this to improved SA and lower workload. ([SpringerLink][9])
* **Compass tape / heading bug** — quick wind-crab corrections and pattern alignment.
* **Speed/altitude tapes** — immediate trend awareness without head-down scanning.
* **Drift vector (“wind triangle”)** — overlays resultant motion over water to aid station-keeping and grid alignment.
* **Target waypoint / marker pipper** — shows last-known position (LKP) and current fix; reduces search pattern errors.
* **AIS overlays (targets + CPA/TCPA)** — situational traffic awareness; avoids conflicts near vessel.
* **Sea-state band & gust index** — small banner: WMO sea state & Beaufort (pilot context). ([Streaming Media][6])
* **Latency indicator** — live **glass-to-glass estimate** (green ≤150 ms; amber 150–200 ms; red >200 ms) to cue conservative inputs when delay rises (ties human-factors thresholds to UI). ([PubMed][3])
* **Recording/telemetry hash badge** — SHA-256 rolling hash status to signal audited recording (for incident review).

### 4.2 Display modality

* **Head-worn (goggles/HWD) or HUD-style overlay** is preferred over heads-down displays for **search/piloting SA**, reducing scan-to-action time. Recent aviation/HUD and AR-HUD studies report **improved situation awareness and reduced workload** with well-designed symbology. ([ScienceDirect][10])

### 4.3 Symbology declutter / modes

* **Takeoff/IRD mode:** attitude + latency + link + heading only (decluttered).
* **Search mode:** add drift vector, LKP marker, AIS contacts, grid cell highlight.
* **Approach/hover mode:** enlarge pipper, add fine-scale speed/altitude tapes, crosshair stabilization.

---

## 5) Engineering controls tied to the budget

* **Codec/profile:** enforce **hardware low-latency** profiles (no B-frames, reduced VBV, short GOP) to cap encode/decode stages; match to VCU low-latency guidance. ([AMD Documentation][4])
* **Transport:** prefer **RTP/RTSP or SRT-Low Latency** on wired/Wi-Fi LAN; monitor queue depth. Industry reviews show delivery method dominates latency variance. ([Streaming Media][6])
* **Backhaul policy:** if backhaul pushes pilot latency >**200 ms**, auto-throttle stick scaling and expand geo-fence; warn PIC via HUD indicator. Thresholds follow teleop performance curves. ([PubMed][3])
* **Periodic verification:** run stopwatch glass-to-glass tests at shift start and after network changes; record medians/95th. ([Wowza][7])

## 6) Reviewer-ready one-liner (paste into Claim 3)

“Auto-launch minimizes time-to-air; dock-class links deliver **≈110–150 ms** video latency, and head-up symbology maintains situation awareness. Keeping **glass-to-glass ≤150–200 ms** holds teleoperation in the **low-impact** regime documented by human-factors research, while bounded autonomy (launch/clear-ship only) limits exposure to UAS reliability tails. Together, this hybrid control is both **faster to first control** and **safer** than fully autonomous or fully manual alternatives.” ([DJI][2])
