# CLAIM — “Cost/benefit and PR risk reduction are compelling.”

## A) Independent evidence (with links)

1. **Direct SAR expense is high (per hour), and multi-asset searches compound the bill**

    * A US National Weather Service report on a SAR hoax details the **USCG HH-60 helicopter operating cost at $6,530/hour** (fuel + staffing), exclusive of fixed costs and additional assets. That incident also launched surface craft. 🔗 [NWS/NOAA](https://www.weather.gov/mlb/mayday_cost)
    * Feature analysis of SAR expenses provides a historical sampling of **hourly Coast Guard aircraft & cutter costs** and notes a full multi-asset evolution can reach **six figures**; lack of precise position (no GPS) has driven **case totals ~$240,000** in documented examples. 🔗 [Soundings: *Rescues aren’t cheap*](https://soundingsonline.com/features/rescues-arent-cheap/)

2. **Cruise delays are expensive even before compensation or PR fallout**

    * Industry analysis estimates **cruise ship fuel alone costs $80,000–$200,000 per day**, i.e., **$3,300–$8,300 per hour**, depending on ship size and bunker prices. This excludes knock-on costs (port fees, missed slots, overtime, comp, itinerary changes). 🔗 [Cruise Hive](https://www.cruisehive.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-fuel-a-cruise-ship/101033)
    * Operational research includes **arrival delay penalty** explicitly in cruise OPEX formulations, recognizing the material **cost-of-delay** component that grows with schedule disruption. 🔗 [E3S Conf. 2024 (Xi et al.)](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2024/42/e3sconf_uct2024_04021.pdf)

3. **PR crises measurably harm brand & demand in cruising**

    * Scholarly review of cruise-line crises documents **reputational damage → demand reduction → revenue loss** without effective mitigation, and stresses proactive crisis systems to reduce exposure. 🔗 [IU ScholarWorks chapter (Liu-Lastres, 2019)](https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/bitstreams/11cad910-8761-4df7-81a4-214baf7cbe70/download)

4. **MOB outcomes: rapid detection changes the story; delayed/failed searches create long, costly operations and negative coverage**

    * Example **successful** case: June 29, 2025 onboard Disney *Dream*—**rapid internal response** and small-boat recovery of a child and father; media framed the incident around **effective protocols** and quick action. 🔗 [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/3333b2eced828426f1ea8df584587c58)
    * Example **unsuccessful** case: USCG **suspends search** for a 72-year-old believed overboard from *Ruby Princess* off California (2024); aerial searches ran before termination—typical of **hours of multi-asset SAR**, significant cost, and recurring negative headlines. 🔗 [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/b1fa49fce53f0d0ad3f51bd1ae2416dd)

5. **Baseline recovery odds are low; technology-assisted detection is being adopted to counter this**

    * Reporting citing USCG figures notes **<19% recovery** in known MOB cases historically—context for why improving **time-to-first-visual** and **marking** has outsize value. 🔗 [gCaptain (2025 roundup)](https://gcaptain.com/cruise-industry-faces-renewed-calls-for-man-overboard-tech-after-father-daughter-rescue/)
    * Major lines are now **deploying overboard detection tech** and publicizing rescues, explicitly linking tech to improved outcomes and reputational benefit. 🔗 [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2025/06/30/cruise-ship-overboard-detection-systems/84416767007/)

**Implication:** Even **one** prolonged MOB search can consume **six-figure** SAR expense and trigger **itinerary delays** (fuel + operations) plus **PR risk**; systems that **cut detection time** and **enable immediate buoy/strobe drops** reduce both **cash outlay** and **headline risk**.

## B) Additional research points (expand with linked sources)

* **Expected-value model of a diverted/loitering cruise**: use fuel/hour (above) + **port/slot penalties** and **crew overtime** (industry reports) to quantify the hourly burn rate for a delay caused by MOB search. (Pair with schedule-disruption literature recognizing delay penalties.) 🔗 [Fuel/OPEX: Cruise Hive](https://www.cruisehive.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-fuel-a-cruise-ship/101033) • 🔗 [E3S 2024 (delay penalty)](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2024/42/e3sconf_uct2024_04021.pdf)
* **Media-exposure valuation**: derive PR-risk proxy by counting national stories per MOB and applying **advertising value equivalency (AVE)** or **share-of-voice shifts** (communications literature). 🔗 [Liu-Lastres 2019](https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/bitstreams/11cad910-8761-4df7-81a4-214baf7cbe70/download)
* **Case library** of MOB timelines: extract **alarm→detection→recovery** from AP/USCG reports for the last 3–5 years; label **assets launched** (helo/cutters), **search duration**, and **result** to parameterize the EV model. 🔗 [AP—examples above](https://apnews.com/article/b1fa49fce53f0d0ad3f51bd1ae2416dd)
* **Counterfactual savings** study: simulate identical incidents with/without **MOB-1** (auto-launch IRD + pilot) using **USCG search theory (POS = POC×POD)** to show **earlier first-visual** → **fewer SAR hours** + **shorter loiter**. 🔗 [USCG *Theory of Search*](https://navcen.uscg.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/Theory_of_Search.pdf)

## C) Quantitative thresholds (business-plan ready)

* **Marginal SAR cost avoided**: **$6,530/hr (helicopter)** × **H hours** + cutter/boat hours (per-asset multipliers) is reducible when **first visual** occurs early and survivor is **marked with strobe/dye** for ship recovery or short-range asset. 🔗 [NOAA/NWS](https://www.weather.gov/mlb/mayday_cost)
* **Delay burn rate (fuel only)**: **$3.3k–$8.3k per hour** (fuel), plus **schedule penalties** and **compensation**; many MOB searches last **multiple hours** even when suspended without recovery. 🔗 [Cruise Hive](https://www.cruisehive.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-fuel-a-cruise-ship/101033) • 🔗 [AP suspension example](https://apnews.com/article/b1fa49fce53f0d0ad3f51bd1ae2416dd)
* **PR downside frequency**: with **hundreds of MOB events** over two decades and **success rates <20%**, the expected number of negative headlines per year for a large brand is non-trivial; each high-visibility case imposes **brand and revenue impact** per crisis-management literature. 🔗 [gCaptain](https://gcaptain.com/cruise-industry-faces-renewed-calls-for-man-overboard-tech-after-father-daughter-rescue/) • 🔗 [Liu-Lastres 2019](https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/bitstreams/11cad910-8761-4df7-81a4-214baf7cbe70/download)

## D) Binder-ready statements (paste-in)

* “A single multi-asset MOB search can cost **five to six figures** in **USCG SAR hours** alone; early UAV visual/marking enables **ship-effected recovery** or a **shorter, localized search**, reducing **helicopter and cutter hours** materially.” ([National Weather Service][1])
* “Cruise delay costs accumulate at **$3–8k/hour in fuel** before port/slot penalties, overtime, or compensation; cutting **loiter and search time** has immediate OPEX benefit.” ([Cruise Hive][2])
* “Crisis-communication scholarship shows cruise incidents **damage reputation and demand**; visibly deploying modern MOB tech and producing **audit-grade evidence** mitigates PR exposure.” ([IU Indianapolis ScholarWorks][3])
* “Probability-weighted UAV search (near-datum plume first) and **rapid buoy/dye/strobe drops** convert a potential **prolonged SAR** into a **controlled recovery narrative**, improving **POS** and **reducing cost/PR risk**.” ([IU Indianapolis ScholarWorks][3])

## F) Executive one-liner

“Every hour of a MOB search burns **thousands in fuel** and **helicopter/cutter costs**, while each high-profile loss drives **reputation damage** and revenue risk; MOB-1’s **fast, probability-weighted detection** and **buoy/dye/strobe marking** compress SAR time, **reduce OPEX**, and **lower PR exposure**—a cost/benefit that pays for itself across even a single avoided prolonged search.”
