# CLAIM  — “Buoy/dye/strobe deployment improves survival odds.”

## A) Independent evidence (tight, citable)

1. **Immediate flotation → higher survival probability in cold water**
   Cold-water immersion research shows the **first minutes** are dominated by the **cold-shock response** (uncontrolled hyperventilation, arrhythmias). Early flotation prevents swim-failure and airway submersion during this period, extending survival time available for rescue. ([The Lancet][1])

2. **High-contrast visual aids raise detection probability (POD)**
   Search doctrine links **POD** to target visibility. IAMSAR/USCG materials formalize POD/POC/POS and emphasize object conspicuity; reflective/lighted/dyed targets improve detection by air/ship lookouts compared with an unmarked head in waves. ([DCO USCG][2])

3. **Dye & strobes are long-standing, standardized SAR aids**

* **Fluorescent sea dye markers**: documented to create a bright slick visible for long durations in daylight (NASA Tech Brief reports **≥12 h** persistence for an evaluated dye block; modern products state **30–40 min** or more, condition-dependent). ([NASA Technical Reports Server][3])
* **Lifebuoy/lifejacket lights (SOLAS/LSA Code)**: self-igniting light must produce **≥2 cd** for **≥2 h** (or flash with equivalent effective intensity), codifying the night-visibility role of strobes. ([Mariner Edition][4])

* **Implication:** A fast UAV drop that puts **buoyancy + day/night conspicuity** on the person in water addresses both sides of survival: (i) **physiology** (stay afloat during cold-shock minutes) and (ii) **search geometry** (raise POD for reacquisition).

---

## B) Quantitative thresholds (business-plan ready)

* **Flotation**: mini-buoy should provide ≥ **7.5 kgf** net buoyancy (reference level used in SOLAS lifejacket criteria; lifebuoys are specified to support **14.5 kg** of iron in fresh water for 24 h). ([Marine Teacher][5])
* **Strobe**: meet or exceed **LSA Code** lifebuoy-light performance (≥ **2 cd**, ≥ **2 h**; many MED/SOLAS units are certified at that level). ([Mariner Edition][4])
* **Dye**: cite conservative daylight visibility: **1+ NM** (commercial product statements) and historical **long-duration slicks (≥12 h)** under favorable seas (NASA Tech Brief). Use conservative planning figures in claims; state that visibility depends on sea state and lighting. ([PRESTO DyeChem][6])
* **Time-to-drop**: objective ≤ **2 min** post-alarm (supported by documented **~70 s** UAV flotation-pod drops in public rescues). ([AOPA][7])

---

## C) Payload engineering research (weight, packaging, deployment)

### C1. Reference implementations & mass/volume

* **Rescue pod used by Little Ripper (SOS Marine)**

  * Packed pod dimensions **≈ 215×290×65 mm**, mass **≈ 798 g** (Australian National Maritime Museum catalog). Inflates on water-contact; provides multi-person flotation; incorporates SOLAS-grade reflective material/light options. ([collections.sea.museum][8])
* **Drop release hardware (representative)**

  * **Mavic 3 Enterprise** drop kit: **~70 g**, **≤ 1 kg** payload rating (single hook). ([drone-payload.com][9])
  * **Universal drop hooks/boxes**: **5–6 kg** rated mechanisms are commercially available for heavier airframes; winch variants add standoff-drop capability. (Specs vary by vendor.) ([UAV Systems International][10])

**Design takeaway:** A **sub-1 kg rescue pod** + **≤ 0.2 kg release** is well within the payload of enterprise multirotors; heavier pods are possible on larger airframes.

### C2. Packaging & environmental robustness

* **Pod**: soft-valise or semi-rigid cassette, sealed against spray; **water-activated CO₂** cartridge (e.g., **~33 g** CO₂) for one-pull inflation; SOLAS-grade high-vis fabric + retro-reflective tape; optional integrated strobe. ([SOS Marine][11])
* **Dye**: sealed sachet or compact canister attached to pod with **time-release membrane** (activates on immersion). Cite commercial dye markers used in aviation/maritime survival kits. ([PRESTO DyeChem][6])
* **Strobe**: **SOLAS/MED-approved lifebuoy light** module with auto-activate on water contact (≥2 cd for ≥2 h). **Mount on pod** to mark the survivor + drop site in surf. ([mars-safety.com][12])

### C3. Deployment mechanics (sequence, height, CEP)

* **Release height**: **10–30 m AGL** to minimize drift and splash hazard; lower if winch-drop hardware is used. (CEP largely governed by hover accuracy and wind; RTK hover can be **decimeter-class** but overall splash-point CEP will be **meter-class** in wind/chop.)
* **Sequence**: arming interlock → payload confirm → release over target → water-triggered inflation (≤ **3–5 s** typical) → strobe auto-on → dye release.
* **Validation precedent**: **Little Ripper** rescues documented **~70 s** launch-to-drop; operationally demonstrates feasibility of precise, rapid flotation delivery. ([AOPA][7])

### C4. Interfaces & serviceability

* **Quick-swap cassette** for pod + dye + strobe; **tamper indicators** and **expiry/date** windows (CO₂ cartridge, battery).
* **Inspection cycle** aligned to SOLAS-style LSA checks (visual, battery check, cartridge weight); corrosion controls per **IEC 60945**/marine practice for any deck-mounted bracketry (if used to store cassettes). ([jotron.com][13])

## D) Binder-ready claim language

“Published immersion research demonstrates that **early flotation during the cold-shock phase** reduces the risk of swim-failure and extends survival time. Standardized visual aids—**fluorescent dye by day** and **SOLAS-conformant strobes by night**—**increase detection probability** under IAMSAR/USCG search constructs. A compact UAV-deployable pod (≈ 0.8 kg packed) with **auto-inflation**, **dye**, and **strobe** can be dropped within **~1–2 min** of alarm, as shown in documented UAV rescues. `CROW` therefore improves survival odds by combining **immediate buoyancy** with **high-contrast marking** in the first minutes post-MOB.” ([The Lancet][1])

## Integration Notes

* **Power:** strobe and inflator are self-contained; no UAV power draw.
* **Activation sequence:** release → water contact → inflator trigger + strobe auto-on + dye dispersal.
* **Serviceability:** pod cassette inspected monthly; CO₂ cartridge/battery replaced every 12–24 mo (per SOLAS LSA cycles).
* **Marinization:** cassette enclosure built to IEC 60945 / MIL-STD-810 Method 509 for salt fog resistance.
